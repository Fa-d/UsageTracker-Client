## Notes & Decisions

### Phase 1 Implementation Notes:
- ✅ Successfully created `ai_insights` dynamic feature module (renamed from `ai-insights` to comply with module naming requirements)
- ✅ Configured Google Play Feature Delivery in main app
- ✅ Added TensorFlow Lite dependencies to AI module 
- ✅ Created AI feature flags in UserPreferences entity with 7 new boolean flags
- ✅ Built comprehensive AI opt-in dialog with animated features showcase
- ✅ Created AI download progress dialog with loading states, progress tracking, and error handling
- ✅ Implemented AI availability check utilities with device compatibility validation
- ✅ Created enhanced AI download progress tracking with detailed state management
- ✅ Added comprehensive AI feature state management in ViewModels (AIViewModel)
- ✅ Built feature toggle functionality with user preferences integration
- ✅ Designed AI insights dashboard components (AIInsightsCard with sample data)
- ✅ Implemented complete AI feature settings screen with feature toggles
- ✅ Added AI status indicators for main UI with compact and full modes
- ✅ Full project compilation successful with both main app and AI module
- 📝 Module structure follows Android best practices for dynamic features

### Challenges & Solutions:
- **Challenge**: Module name with hyphens (`ai-insights`) caused build failure
  **Solution**: Renamed to `ai_insights` using underscores as required by Android
- **Challenge**: Hilt dependency injection setup conflicts in dynamic module
  **Solution**: Simplified initial module setup without Hilt, will add back later when stable
- **Challenge**: Compose compiler plugin requirement for dynamic modules
  **Solution**: Added `org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose` plugin to AI module
- **Challenge**: Cross-module type sharing for AIDownloadState
  **Solution**: Moved shared types to main app module for now, will refactor during integration
- **Challenge**: Hilt Context binding missing for AIDownloadManager
  **Solution**: Added @ApplicationContext annotation to Context parameter in constructor
- **Challenge**: AIFeatureState import missing in AISettingsScreen
  **Solution**: Added explicit import for AIFeatureState from viewmodels package
