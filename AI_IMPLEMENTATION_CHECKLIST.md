- **Challenge**: Compose compiler plugin requirement for dynamic modules
  **Solution**: Added `org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose` plugin to AI module
- **Challenge**: Cross-module type sharing for AIDownloadState
  **Solution**: Moved shared types to main app module for now, will refactor during integration
- **Challenge**: Hilt Context binding missing for AIDownloadManager
  **Solution**: Added @ApplicationContext annotation to Context parameter in constructor
- **Challenge**: AIFeatureState import missing in AISettingsScreen
